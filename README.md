# Little Red Riding Hood

* The project implements a A* algorithm visualizer based on code: https://github.com/Tauseef-Hilal/Pathfinding-Visualizer
* On top of this, it uses a pretrained image classification to detect flower types: https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1lltqJOgnhPkjOdDzkJbSIvDQERnqm8r0?usp=sharing
    * The dataset is https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/alxmamaev/flowers-recognition
    * The dataset includes 4322 flower images from 5 classes.
* 5 randomly selected free cells in the map gets assigned a flower image. Then the path for visiting each flower is found and visited. On the visit, the images are classified and the results are displayed. Example run: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ypYyzN_NjPE
